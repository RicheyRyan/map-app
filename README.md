## Notes on the Implementation

### Materiaul UI

Material UI was used for the basic components. It provides a solid basis on which to build out an app and frees time that would otherwise be spent implementing and testing basic functionality for your business logic.

It is highly themeable and adaptable, so concerns like branding or whitelabelling are easily achieveable.

### Google Maps API Key

I have included my Google Maps API key for convenience. It is restricted to localhost and the specific APIs that I required.
